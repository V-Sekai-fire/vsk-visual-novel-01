**Immediate Detail:**  
The barroom air chokes on whiskey fumes and burnt plastic. Rain hammers tin rooftops like machine gun fire, muffling the gangster’s neural port—static ghosts dance in the flickering light.  

**Threat/Opportunity:**  
His glitching port is a backdoor into his augments. But he’s loading that plasma pistol, and the Clock ticks louder with every *sizzle* of static.  

**Clock Status:**  
◎◎◯◯◯◯ – Sirens claw closer; the bar’s neon pulses in sync with your heartbeat.  

**Player Options:**  
1. **Bribe**: Flash a data stick loaded with “black market credits.”  
2. **Charm**: Feed him a neural cocktail that makes him forget you’re here.  
3. **Threaten**: Aim the hidden blade at his glitching port—*one move and it’ll fry*.  
4. **Hack**: Plug into his ghosted static, but risk frying your own augments.  

**<game>**  
[Action 1: Player plugs a data stick into a terminal (Bribe). Sparks, then a glitching screen.]  
[Action 2: Neural cocktail fails—gangster’s eyes roll back (Charm penalty).]  
[Action 3: Hack attempt fries both ports; SWAT sirens surge closer (Clock fills one slot).]  
**</game>**

**<highlights>**  
- **Raining Acid**: Trench coats dissolve, exposing your augments to the stench of circuit rot.  
- **Ghosts in the Machine**: The gangster’s port is a ticking bomb—hack it and you might steal his secrets… or detonate both your minds.  
**</highlights>**

**<decisions>**  
- Choose **Hack** to exploit the glitch, but accept 50% chance of augment burnout.  
- If you survive, the Clock resets—but the gangster’s secrets might save your life next time.
