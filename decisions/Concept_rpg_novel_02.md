**Title**: _"Designing Under Constraints: How We Built a Social VR RPG in 7 Days"_

---

> Imagine convincing a cybernetic gangster to spare your bar—not with guns, but with a spinning wheel of lies, charm, and digital sabotage. This is the heart of _Neon Dragon_, a game we built in one week using Godot, VR, and ruthless scope control. Let me show you how constraints fueled creativity.

### **The 7-Day Blueprint**

_(Visual: A timeline with key milestones)_

1. **Day 1: The Wheel of Misfortune**

   - _"We started with Oblivion’s infamous speechcraft wheel—but stripped it to 4 actions: Bribe, Charm, Threaten, Hack. No art, no code—just sticky notes and a dream."_

2. **Day 2: Math Over Madness**

   - _"Each action had a fixed value. Charm = +2, Threaten = +1. Success required +5 points. Simple math meant less debugging, more storytelling."_

3. **Day 3: The Lone NPC**

   - _"One NPC. Two poses. Arms crossed (angry) or hands on hips (calm). We reused V-SEKAI’s default avatar—no time for custom art."_

4. **Day 4: Gaze, Don’t Touch**

   - _"VR interaction? Gaze and click. Players look at an option, click a button. No fancy gestures—just survival."_

5. **Day 5: Feedback Loop**

   - _"A tiny text label: ‘Disposition +3’. The NPC shifts stance. Minimalist feedback kept players focused on the wheel."_

6. **Day 6: Playtest Panic**

   - _"Testers hated grinding. So we slashed the win threshold from +5 to +3. Lesson: Fun beats realism."_

7. **Day 7: The Neon Glow**
   - _"One flickering hologram. Two exports. Done. Our bar was bare, but the wheel? It spun with possibility."_

### **Key Takeaways**

_(Visual: Side-by-side of initial vision vs. final product)_

1. **Constraints Breed Innovation**

   - _"Cutting scope to 25% forced us to polish our core mechanic—the wheel—into a narrative device."_

2. **Prototype Fast, Iterate Faster**

   - _"Day 1: Paper prototype. Day 2: Digital. Day 3: Test. Speed revealed flaws before they became crises."_

3. **The Power of One**

   - _"One NPC, one room, one encounter. By focusing on a single ‘moment’, we made players feel powerful in 2 minutes."_

4. **Embrace the Jank**
   - _"Our NPC’s ‘angry’ pose was a default avatar crossing its arms. Players filled the gaps with their imagination."_

### **Closing Provocation**

_"Next time you’re overwhelmed by a project, ask: What’s my wheel? Cut everything else. Sometimes, all you need is one mechanic, one room, and a flicker of neon to tell a story that sticks."_
