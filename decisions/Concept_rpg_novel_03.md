**Proposed TED Talk Draft: "Designing Under Constraints: How We Built a Social VR RPG in 7 Days"**

Imagine a cybernetic gangster in a neon-lit Hong Kong bar, his glowing eyes narrowed as you spin a wheel of lies, charm, and sabotage to negotiate your survival. This is _Neon Dragon_—a social VR RPG we built in seven days using Godot, ruthless prioritization, and a philosophy that constraints are not limits, but creative fuel. Let me take you through our journey.

### **The 7-Day Sprint: From Chaos to Clarity**

**Day 1** began with a single question: _What’s the core interaction?_ We borrowed Oblivion’s speechcraft wheel, stripped it to four actions (Bribe, Charm, Threaten, Hack), and sketched it on sticky notes. No code, no art—just the skeleton of a mechanic.

By **Day 2**, math became our ally. Charm added +2 points, Threaten +1. A fixed threshold of +5 for success replaced complex systems, freeing us to focus on narrative tension.

**Day 3** forced art austerity: a single NPC, recycled from V-SEKAI’s default avatar, cycled between two poses—arms crossed (angry) and hands on hips (calm). Custom animations were axed; storytelling became the priority.

**Day 4** tackled VR interaction. Instead of gesture-based controls, we opted for gaze-and-click: stare at an option, press a button. It was functional, not elegant.

**Day 5** introduced minimalist feedback: a tiny “Disposition +3” label and the NPC’s stance shift.

**Day 6** brought a revolt. Playtesters hated grinding, so we slashed the win threshold to +3. The lesson? _Fun beats realism._ 

On **Day 7**, we added a flickering hologram, exported the build, and called it done. The bar was bare, but the wheel—the heart of the experience—spun with purpose.

### **Key Insights: Constraints as Catalysts**

A side-by-side comparison tells the story:

| **Initial Vision**        | **Final Reality**               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Complex dialogue trees    | A single wheel mechanic         |
| Custom NPC animations     | Two poses from a default avatar |
| Gesture-based VR controls | Gaze-and-click simplicity       |

Reducing scope to 25% transformed the wheel from a mechanic into a narrative anchor. Speed was critical: paper prototypes on Day 1 became digital by Day 2, tested by Day 3. Flaws surfaced early, sparing us costly late-stage fixes. Focusing on a single moment—one NPC, one room, one encounter—let players master the system in two minutes. And embracing imperfection paid off: players projected depth onto our recycled animations, proving that _jank can spark imagination_.

### **Closing Reflection: The Soul of Scarcity**

> _“What’s your wheel?_ Strip away the excess. Sometimes, all you need is one mechanic, one room, and a flickering hologram to tell a story that lingers.”

### **Visual Storytelling for the Stage**

The talk opens with a slide drenched in neon: rain-slick Hong Kong streets from 2080, holographic ads flickering above crowds. Slide two juxtaposes our scrappy, hand-drawn wheel sketch with the final Godot UI—a testament to minimalist execution. Slide three loops the NPC shifting from crossed arms to hands on hips, a study in resourcefulness. The finale overlays _“Fun beats realism”_ onto a screenshot of the disposition text, driving home the game’s ethos.

Constraints didn’t shackle _Neon Dragon_. They gave it life. And if a scrappy team can build a story that sticks in seven days, imagine what you could create by embracing your limits.
