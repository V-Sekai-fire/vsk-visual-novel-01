**Final TED Talk Script**

**[Slide 1: Neon-lit Hong Kong 2080 mood board. Rain, holograms, crowded streets.]**  
**Speaker**: Imagine a cybernetic gangster in a neon-lit Hong Kong bar. His eyes glow red as he leans across the counter, demanding answers. You don’t have a gun. Instead, you spin a wheel of lies, charm, and digital sabotage. This is _Neon Dragon_—a social VR RPG we built in seven days. And today, I’ll show you how constraints became our greatest creative tool.

**[Slide 2: Hand-drawn wheel sketch vs. minimalist Godot UI]**  
**Speaker**: Let’s rewind to Day 1. Our starting question was simple: _What’s the core interaction?_ We took inspiration from Oblivion’s speechcraft wheel, stripped it to four actions—Bribe, Charm, Threaten, Hack—and sketched it on sticky notes. No code, no art. Just the skeleton of a mechanic.

By Day 2, math became our ally. Charm added +2 points, Threaten +1. A fixed threshold of +5 for success replaced complex systems. Why? Because simple math meant less debugging and more time crafting narrative tension.

**[Slide 3: Default NPC avatar in angry vs. calm poses]**  
**Speaker**: Day 3 forced brutal choices. Art? We recycled a default avatar from V-SEKAI. Two poses: arms crossed (angry) and hands on hips (calm). No custom animations. Instead, we focused on storytelling—how a single NPC’s stance could convey threat or trust.

Day 4: VR interaction. Gestures? Too time-consuming. We chose gaze-and-click: stare at an option, press a button. Functional, not elegant. But it worked.

**[Slide 4: “Disposition +3” text label with NPC stance shift]**  
**Speaker**: Day 5 introduced minimalist feedback. A tiny “Disposition +3” label. The NPC shifted stance. That’s it. No fanfare. We realized players didn’t need explosions—they needed clarity.

Then came Day 6. Playtesters revolted. “Grinding is boring!” So we slashed the win threshold from +5 to +3. Lesson learned: _Fun beats realism._

**[Slide 5: Flickering hologram in the sparse bar environment]**  
**Speaker**: On Day 7, we added one flickering hologram, exported the build, and called it done. The bar was bare. But the wheel—the heart of the experience—spun with purpose.

**[Slide 6: Side-by-side table of initial vision vs. final reality]**  
**Speaker**: Let’s compare. Initially, we dreamed of complex dialogue trees. We shipped a single wheel. Custom animations? Two poses. Gesture controls? Gaze-and-click. By cutting scope to 25%, we transformed the wheel from a mechanic into a narrative anchor.

**[Slide 7: Looping NPC pose transition]**  
**Speaker**: Speed was critical. Paper prototypes on Day 1 became digital by Day 2, tested by Day 3. Flaws surfaced early. And focusing on one moment—one NPC, one room—let players feel mastery in two minutes.

But here’s the twist: embracing imperfection worked. Players projected depth onto our janky animations. That default avatar crossing its arms? They saw a gangster’s simmering rage. _Jank sparked imagination._

**[Slide 8: “Fun beats realism” quote over disposition text]**  
**Speaker**: So what’s the takeaway?

_Lean into constraints._ Ask: _What’s your wheel?_ Strip away the excess. Sometimes, all you need is one mechanic, one room, and a flickering hologram to tell a story that sticks.

**[Slide 9: Neon Dragon logo with tagline “Constraints Create Soul”]**  
**Speaker**: Constraints didn’t limit _Neon Dragon_. They gave it life. And if a scrappy team can build a story that lingers in seven days, imagine what you could create by embracing your limits.

Thank you.
