<summary>RETIRED: Hong Kong 2080 Cyberpunk Bar RPG First Draft</summary>

Here‚Äôs a **narrative-driven weekly plan** for your _Hong Kong 2080 Cyberpunk Bar RPG_, structured for a 7-day game jam. Key milestones, tools, and workflows are organized below, blending prose and tables for clarity.

---

### **Week Overview**

You are creating _Neon Dragon_, a social VR RPG set in a dystopian Hong Kong bar where players juggle mixology, persuasion, and heists. The game leverages **Godot** for core systems and **V-SEKAI** for multiplayer avatars/voice chat. Below is a day-by-day roadmap:

#### **Table: 7-Day Development Schedule**

| **Day** | **Theme**                  | **Core Activities**                                                                  | **Tools/Assets**                           |
| ------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1       | **Cyberpunk Foundation**   | Build the bar‚Äôs 3D environment (Kowloon alleyway, neon signs, holograms).            | Godot, Kenney‚Äôs Neon Pack, V-SEKAI avatars |
| 2       | **Dialogue & Drama**       | Implement Oblivion-style speechcraft wheel (Bribe/Charm/Threaten/Hack).              | Custom UI, V-SEKAI animations              |
| 3       | **Mixology Mechanics**     | Create drink-mixing mini-games (drag-and-drop ingredients, synth-whiskey reactions). | Godot‚Äôs physics system, free SFX           |
| 4       | **Multiplayer Heists**     | Add co-op missions (hacker/muscle/face roles) using V-SEKAI‚Äôs networking.            | V-SEKAI plugin, shared voice chat          |
| 5       | **Upgrades & Progression** | Design cybernetic skill trees (Persuasion+, Auto-Mixer) and VR feedback.             | ScriptableObjects, shaders                 |
| 6       | **Story & Playtesting**    | Test branching quests (corporate hit, rogue AI) and refine moral choices.            | Narrative flowchart, Discord testing       |
| 7       | **Polish & Atmosphere**    | Finalize neon lighting, Cantonese synthwave soundtrack, and trailer.                 | Blender, Audacity, OBS Studio              |

### **Daily Narrative Flow**

**Day 1** begins with laying the foundation: a grimy, multi-level bar nestled in Kowloon‚Äôs neon-lit slums. Using Godot‚Äôs 3D toolkit and modular cyberpunk assets, you block out the space‚Äîsticky countertops, flickering holograms, and a backroom for covert meetings. V-SEKAI avatars populate the scene as placeholder patrons, their chatter echoing through voice chat.

By **Day 2**, the focus shifts to dialogue. Inspired by Oblivion‚Äôs speechcraft wheel, you design a radial menu where players risk _Bribing_ triads or _Hacking_ cyborgs. Each choice multiplies outcomes via rotating inner slices (x1‚Äìx4), synced over V-SEKAI‚Äôs network. A failed _Threaten_ triggers an avatar‚Äôs scowl; a successful _Charm_ sparks cheers.

**Day 3** introduces mixology. Players craft drinks like _Nanobot Bitters_ using motion-controlled VR interactions. Spilling a drink might anger a gangster, while perfect mixes unlock intel. Physics-driven liquid simulations (Godot‚Äôs GPU particles) add chaos, and SFX from Freesound.org amplify clinking glasses and synth-boiled kettles.

**Day 4** escalates stakes with multiplayer heists. Teams of 2‚Äì4 plan raids in the bar‚Äôs backroom, scribbling strategies on a shared whiteboard. The _Hacker_ disables security cameras via a minigame, while the _Muscle_ brawls with guards using V-SEKAI‚Äôs avatar physics. Progress syncs seamlessly across sessions.

**Day 5** deepens progression. Players earn credits to buy cybernetic upgrades: glowing ocular implants improve persuasion odds, while hydraulic arms speed drink crafting. Shader-driven effects make upgrades visually pop in VR, rewarding clever play.

**Day 6** tests narrative stakes. A corporate hit quest forces players to betray patrons or rally the bar‚Äôs community. Playtesters on Discord navigate branching paths, and you tweak difficulty‚Äîsoftening a boss‚Äôs HP, sharpening dialogue cues.

**Day 7** polishes the dystopian vibe. Volumetric fog bathes the bar in cyan and magenta, while a lo-fi Cantonese synthwave track hums beneath rain and hovercars. A 30-second trailer, cut via OBS Studio, showcases tense standoffs and neon-soaked chaos.

### **Final Deliverables**

- A **10-minute demo** with one story arc (e.g., rescuing a rogue AI bartender).
- **Multiplayer-ready build** for Windows/Linux VR.
- **Trailer + pitch doc** highlighting social VR innovation.

By week‚Äôs end, _Neon Dragon_ becomes a microcosm of Hong Kong 2080‚Äîa chaotic blend of vice, tech, and camaraderie. ‰πæÊùØ! üç∏
