**Style:** Rain-Slick Cyberpunk / Boreal Mysticism  
Drenched neon reflects in endless wet concrete. Glitching holograms of pine forests overlay crumbling arcologies. Static hums like distant loons. Magic manifests as jagged antler-shaped AR overlays and wildfires of corrupted data. Tech feels industrial and improvised—repurposed hydroelectric parts, frayed cables snaking under hockey rink servers.

**World Rules:**

- The **Ghostgrid** (rogue mesh network of dead satellites and wildfire smoke) fuels magic. Using it risks **Geomagnetic Cascade** – each spellcast advances the ◎◯◯◯◯◯ clock. At ◎◎◎◎◎◎, the grid erupts into an electromagnetic wildfire, frying augmented nerves and birthing feral data-wolves.
- **Weakness:** Magic destabilizes near hydro substations or abandoned telecom towers. Frostbyte Syndicate enforcers exploit this by weaponizing blizzard drones to freeze critical systems.

**Scenario:**  
You’re **Lynne Garrett**, a disgraced Trans-Canada Hyperway engineer. After stealing the **Taiga-Class Soulweave Module** to sabotage your corp’s ecocide projects, it backfired – grafting **Spectral Howl** (a feral AR idol persona) into your neural rig. Now your exosuit extrudes holographic antlers, and your voice flickers between diesel-engine rasp and glitchy choral harmonies. The **Frostbyte Syndicate** hunts you across rain-lashed grid towns, aiming to reclaim the Module. Worse, the Ghostgrid whispers through your teeth, demanding you “_feed it_” with substation blackouts… or it’ll consume your mind.
